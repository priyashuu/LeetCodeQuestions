# Advanced Data Structures â€“ LeetCode Practice

Welcome to my ongoing repository dedicated to solving LeetCode questions!  
This repo is a personal journey to improve my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of data structures and algorithms.

## About

- **Purpose:** Practice and document solutions for a wide range of LeetCode problems.
- **Status:** Actively updated as I learn new concepts and tackle more questions.
- **Structure:** Problems are organized by topic (e.g., Arrays, LinkedList) with each folder containing solutions in Java.

## Contributing

I appreciate feedback, better solutions, and suggestions for new problems to solve!  
Feel free to:
- Submit improved solutions for existing questions.
- Recommend must-solve questions for mastering DSA.
- Share tips or resources for effective problem solving.

## Future Plans

- Attach personal notes and explanations for each question.
- Expand coverage to include more advanced topics and patterns.

## Happy DSA Programming!
